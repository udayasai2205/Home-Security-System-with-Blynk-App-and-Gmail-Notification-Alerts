Project Explanation
Home Security System Using Blynk and Gmail Notification Alerts

This project involves creating a home security system that utilizes the Blynk app for remote monitoring and control. The system will employ various sensors to detect unauthorized access and send real-time notifications via Gmail whenever an intrusion is detected.

Key Features:

Blynk App Integration: Allows users to monitor sensor status and control devices remotely.
Gmail Notifications: Sends email alerts when an intrusion is detected, ensuring users are promptly informed.
Sensor Components: Utilizes components such as PIR motion sensors, door/window sensors, and possibly a camera for added security.
Microcontroller: Typically based on an ESP8266 or Arduino, which connects to Wi-Fi to communicate with the Blynk app and send emails.
